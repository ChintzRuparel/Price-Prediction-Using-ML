## Price Predictions Using ML 

<h3>Stock Market Prediction with comparative analysis of Linear Regression, KNN and LSTM.</h3>

Predicting how the stock market will perform is one of the most difficult things to do. There are so many factors involved in the prediction – physical factors vs. psychological, rational and irrational behavior, etc. All these aspects combine to make share prices volatile and very difficult to predict with a high degree of accuracy. Using features like the latest announcements about an organization, their quarterly revenue results, etc., machine learning techniques have the potential to unearth patterns and insights we didn’t see before, and these can be used to make unerringly accurate predictions. I have implemented a machine learning algorithms to predict the future stock price of TATAGLOBAL company using linear regression, KNN and LSTM.
